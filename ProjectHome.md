ESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API) is a free, open source, web application security control library that makes it easier for programmers to write lower-risk applications. The ESAPI libraries are designed to make it easier for programmers to retrofit security into existing applications or build a solid foundation for new development.

The Force.com implementation of the ESAPI library is designed and customized for the security needs of the Force.com platform.

The modules currently implemented are:
  * Input Validation
  * Output Encoding
  * Access Control for Force.com objects (CRUD/FLS and Sharing)
